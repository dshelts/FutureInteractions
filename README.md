Week 1
- Familiarizing ourselves with the documentation of Leap motion, and analysis or sample code "sample.py" this is part of the sdk package downloaded through https://developer.leapmotion.com. A lot of trying to figure out group dynamics as well as trying to figure out how to start.




Week 3
<<<<<<< HEAD
- meeting 9/10/13 -- 3:30pm topics: getting everyone squared away with pygames and github. Setting goals and establishing the next step.
=======
-	This week I worked on the bouncing ball program using the pygame graphics library. I collaborated with my room mate Bryan and drew to get the class parts of the program functional,  and implemented a new style of drawing the ball onto the screen without having the frame rate look bad. 
-	Right now the leap motions input is signified by a variable colored and sized dot.
